üìÑ Report: Learnings from Algorithmic Trading using Python and C++ integration (ID:86)

üìå Introduction

In this project, I utilized and implemented a rule based backtesting framework to backtest a simple but sound intraday trading strategy. The backtesting framework backtested a range of stocks listed on the Indian stock exchange based on data at 15 minute intervals over a 30 day time span. The primary objective was to identify long and short opportunities by using a combination of technical indicators like Bollinger Bands and RSI.

üß† Key Learnings

1. üìà Financial Markets and Indicators
	‚Ä¢	Bollinger Bands: I learned how Bollinger Bands can be used to identify volatility extremes. Specifically:
	‚Ä¢	Price falling below the lower band might indicate oversold conditions (buy signal).
	‚Ä¢	Price rising above the upper band might indicate overbought conditions (sell signal).
	‚Ä¢	RSI (Relative Strength Index): Helped me filter high-probability trade setups by confirming overbought/oversold signals.
	‚Ä¢	Combining Indicators: I understood that using multiple indicators together (like BB and RSI) can reduce false signals and improve strategy robustness.

2. üß™ Backtesting Concepts
	‚Ä¢	Strategy Logic: I built logic to simulate both long and short trades based on entry signals and computed returns.
	‚Ä¢	Risk-Reward Calculation: I applied a risk to reward ratio of 1:1.5 to simulate realistic trade exits using dynamically calculated stoploss levels based on recent price extremes.
	‚Ä¢	Performance Metrics:
	‚Ä¢	Win Rate: Percentage of trades that were profitable.
	‚Ä¢	Average Return: Mean return per trade.
	‚Ä¢	Profit Factor: Ratio of gross profits to gross losses, which helped measure the efficiency of the strategy.

3. üß† Python & Libraries
	‚Ä¢	pandas: For data manipulation, rolling windows, and signal creation.
	‚Ä¢	yfinance: For downloading historical stock price data at 15 minute intervals.
	‚Ä¢	ta (Technical Analysis library): To compute indicators like RSI and Bollinger Bands with ease.
	‚Ä¢	Exception Handling: Used try except blocks to ensure the system doesn‚Äôt break when data is missing or APIs fail.

4. ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm Design
	‚Ä¢	Built a modular structure with reusable functions: fetch_data() and apply_strategy().
	‚Ä¢	Implemented a simple position management system to prevent overlapping trades.
	‚Ä¢	Ensured that trades were based on confirmed signals and exited with a clear logic using stoploss and target estimation.

5. üìÅ Data Handling and Reporting
	‚Ä¢	Exported results using pandas.DataFrame.to_csv() to create:
	‚Ä¢	backtest_results.csv: For an overview of strategy performance per stock.
	‚Ä¢	Learned how to handle missing or incomplete data for specific tickers gracefully.
	‚Ä¢	Developed a clean and readable terminal output for fast diagnostics and iteration.

üîç Challenges Faced
	‚Ä¢	Initially, I struggled with understanding the proper way to simulate trade exits and implement stoploss-based calculations.
	‚Ä¢	Another issue was handling position overlap, if not properly coded, multiple signals would trigger multiple entries.
	‚Ä¢	Additionally, I had to tune the signal thresholds to find a balance between signal quantity and quality.

‚úÖ Outcomes

By the end of this project:
  ‚Ä¢ I gained a basic knowledge of quantitative strategy formulation. 
  ‚Ä¢ I wrote an operational backtest engine from scratch using real data. 
  ‚Ä¢ Enhanced confidence in using Python for financial data analysis and prototyping of strategies. 
  ‚Ä¢ I outlined some areas of future development: including the addition of position sizing, multi-bar exits, and live trading hooks.
